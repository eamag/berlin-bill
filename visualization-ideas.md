# 10 Data Visualization Ideas for Berlin Open Data

Here are 10 ideas for data visualizations based on the datasets available on the Berlin Open Data portal.

1.  **Public Transport Accessibility Map:** An interactive map showing the density of public transport stops (bus, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, tram) across different Berlin districts. This would use the VBB-Fahrplandaten via GTFS dataset. Users could filter by transport type and see which areas are best and worst served.

2.  **Berlin Marathon Analysis:** A visualization of the Berlin Marathon results over the years. This could show the distribution of finishing times, the number of participants from different countries, and how these trends have changed. I would need to find a dataset for this, but it's a popular event so it should be available.

3.  **Green Spaces in Berlin:** A map visualizing the distribution and size of public parks and green spaces in Berlin. This could be combined with demographic data to show the amount of green space per capita in different neighborhoods. The "Geographie und Stadtplanung" category seems promising for this.

4.  **COVID-19 Case Progression vs. Vaccination Rates:** A time-series visualization comparing the number of COVID-19 cases in Berlin with the vaccination rates. This could be a dual-axis line chart to show the correlation between the two. The "Gesundheit" category has several relevant datasets.

5.  **Berlin's Bicycle Infrastructure Growth:** A map showing the growth of bicycle lanes and infrastructure in Berlin over time. This would require historical data, which might be available in the "Verkehr" category. It could highlight areas with significant improvements and those still lacking.

6.  **Energy Consumption and Production in Berlin:** A dashboard visualizing Berlin's energy consumption and production from renewable and non-renewable sources. This could include charts showing trends over time and a map of energy infrastructure. The "Ver- und Entsorgung" category would be the place to look.

7.  **Berlin School Performance and Demographics:** An interactive map that correlates school performance data (e.g., graduation rates, test scores) with the demographic and socioeconomic data of the surrounding area. This would use a combination of datasets from the "Bildung" and "Demographie" categories.

8.  **Berlin Crime Hotspots and Trends:** A heatmap of Berlin showing crime hotspots for different types of crime. This could also include a time-series analysis to show how crime rates have changed over the years in different districts. I would need to check for a suitable dataset, likely in the "Öffentliche Verwaltung" section.

9.  **Interactive Tree Map of Berlin's Urban Forest:** A visualization of the different tree species found in Berlin's streets and parks. Users could click on different areas of the map to see the most common tree types. This would use a tree registry dataset, which I've seen in other open data portals.

10. **Startup Ecosystem Growth in Berlin:** A visualization showing the growth of the startup scene in Berlin. This could include the number of new companies founded each year, the amount of venture capital investment, and the most popular industries. The "Wirtschaft" category would be the source for this data.
